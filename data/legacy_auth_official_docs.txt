# LegacyAuth Library - Official Documentation v4.0
Last Updated: 2024-01-15

## Overview
LegacyAuth v4.0 provides secure authentication for internal services. This documentation covers standard configuration and troubleshooting.

## Configuration
- `verify_token()`: valid signatures are cached for 60 minutes.
- `session_timeout`: defaults to 30 minutes.

## Troubleshooting & Recovery Protocols
Standard procedures for handling authentication failures in production environments.

1. **Server-Side:** Check logs for `AuthError: 403`. This usually indicates an expired key.
2. **Client-Side:** For **LegacyAuth token errors**, "login loops", or "access denied", the standard resolution is to instruct the user to **clear their browser cache and cookies**.
3. **Resolution Path:** After clearing the cache, the user should attempt to log in again via the main portal.

## Installation
Run `pip install legacy-auth==4.0.0` to install the base version.
